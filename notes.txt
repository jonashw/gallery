An image browsing library that can be shaped for multiple applications.
Under all circumstances, flexibility and configurability (perhaps with some smart defaults) will be favored.
The problem domain should be closely examined and divided among several components.
All screen sizes must be supported.  The viewer(s) must have a concept of an image group (typical circular browse) but must also have an option
for a solo view.  I will also need a way to indicate how the viewer is to get more grouped images that involves AJAX or some other remote linkage,
as loading all grouped photos on the same page every time is simply not an option (I need photo groups to be browsed from a news feed, for instance). I will also need to be able to load arbitrary content alongside an image.. I'm thinking comments and links, facebook style.
